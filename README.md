# Hi there, I’m Sambhav Surana! 👋

**AI/ML Developer · Python & Full-stack · Real-time Computer Vision**

I’m a third-year CSE (AI-IBM) student who builds practical AI systems — from custom models and multi-agent pipelines to high-throughput real-time face recognition. I enjoy turning complex research ideas into reliable software and production-ready services.

## 🚀 Focus & Current Work

* Fine-tuning LLMs and building agent/workflow orchestration with **LangChain**.
* Deployment & integration: **FastAPI**, **Gradio**, **Next.js**, **Docker**, **Nginx**.
* Real-time CV systems using **YOLO (v11)**, **face_recognition/OpenCV**, and **ChromaDB** for vector retrieval.
* Building parameter-efficient models and training loops (PyTorch, mixed precision, optimization strategies).

## 🔭 Selected Projects

* **Multi-Agents — Automated Product Development**
  Orchestrated a 7-stage LangChain multi-agent pipeline (Product Manager, Engineer, Risk Analyst, Clarifier, etc.) to autonomously generate product blueprints. Deployed with FastAPI + Next.js + Docker.
  Repo: `https://github.com/Sambhav242005/Multi-Agents`

* **Real-Time AI Face Recognition System**
  High-throughput face tracking using YOLOv11 + vector DB (ChromaDB), multi-process architecture (detection / encoding / rendering) for low latency and scalable identification.
  Repo: `https://github.com/Sambhav242005/AI-Face-Detect…`

* **Savant — Custom Universal Transformer**
  Parameter-efficient recurrent transformer built in PyTorch with liquid gating and a logic-heavy training strategy to improve reasoning density.

* **Prime-Paradox (CampusCare)**
  Multi-agent intelligent medical ecosystem using LangGraph & OpenRouter, Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend for real-time monitoring and doctor-patient workflows.

## Quick ways to collaborate

* Need a realtime CV system demo? I can provide a Gradio/RT demo of YOLO + face recognition.
* Building agent orchestration? I can help design the LangChain stage flow and error-handling logic.
* Interested in model fine-tuning? I can help set up LoRA/PEFT pipelines and evaluation metrics.
